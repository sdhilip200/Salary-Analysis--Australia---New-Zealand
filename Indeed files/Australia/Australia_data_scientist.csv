About you
This could be a good fit if:
You rejoice in identifying tough problems that can be solved with the application of scientific thinking, algorithms and analytical data processing.
You understand that solving worthwhile problems means covering all areas of the data lifecycle - finding it, understanding it, experimenting with it, despairing over it, fixing it, …
You’re comfortable reading ML research papers, keep abreast of new work on arXiv.org and have on occasion spent your weekends tinkering around with that interesting new framework you read about recently ... but when it comes down to it, you want to solve real business problems in the simplest and most robust way possible
You’re comfortable working with subject matter experts from all corners of the company to deeply understand the customer problem before getting your hands dirty with all that data and code
Experience as a hands-on practitioner building productionized machine learning pipelines which touch real human end users. (Note, we do not have any graduate roles available at this time.)
You have a solid grasp of statistics and at the more senior end of things you will hopefully have wrestled with the challenges inherent in actually measuring the impact of your machine learning pipelines in the wild
You’ve learned through experience that it’s important to write testable, repeatable code so you can debug it when something goes bump in the night
You know your way around the ‘nix command line, ssh your way happily around your multiple running AWS instances and are a competent programmer in Python, Scala or similar
What success looks like
We are delivering intelligent products and services to market and improving the user experience across our product portfolio
We’re utilizing an appropriate range of machine learning techniques - simple where it works, complex where it is required.

At Resolution, our Remarkable legacy is seen in our orange cow. Orange symbolises enthusiasm, creativity, success, intelligence and determination.
To be Remarkable is to be “Worth talking about. Worth noticing. Exceptional. New. Interesting”.

485,Senior Web Developer,Portable,Melbourne VIC,"About Portable

Our mission is to seek out areas of social need and policy failure and make transformational change using design and technology. We believe that government, organisations and businesses can be forces for good. But there's a gap in their understanding of, and ability to meet, the expectations of those in need of positive change. Our job is to use design and technology to narrow the gap between those with the power and responsibility to make a positive change, and those who need it.

We've recently launched an ODR (Online Dispute Resolution) product into public beta testing with Legal Aid NSW in order to provide a simpler way for couples to split amicably. Some of the key technical pieces included deploying the infrastructure on AWS using the serverless framework in conjunction with CloudFormation to fill in other required services. There was also a significant piece of work in which a python application running on ElasticBeanstalk provides predictions on asset splits by training a machine learning algorithm with historical anonymised data.

As an agency we have a number of projects running in different technical stacks, however we favour specific stacks for greenfield projects for a given project shape. Here are some examples.

Highly available modular web applications and services

Serverless with a NodeJS API
React JS frontend with Redux store
AWS Cognito, S3, SES, DynamoDB, etc
Prototypes and small-mid sized web applications

NodeJS based server
REST API written with NestJS
Deployed to PaaS solutions such as Heroku, ElasticBeanstalk, etc
Information based websites

PHP
Wordpress core (using the roots.io stack)
Kinsta hosting platform
ReactJS for advanced behaviour or features within the website
Enterprise/Government related sites

PHP
Silverstripe web framework or Drupal
Whilst not critical that you've worked with the exact stacks that we've listed, you probably are familiar with some of these technologies / frameworks, even if you haven't used them in a professional context:

PostgreSQL
MySQL / MariaDB / Galera
Vue/Angular/NextJS
Webpack / Parcel
Docker / containerisation
Go
Drupal / Joomla
An example of what a day a Portable as a Senior Web Developer might look like:

Reviewing a few pull requests to help individuals and the team grow with their ability to commit good code to projects
Pairing and mentoring on a feature with a mid-level or junior developer to provide directed advice and guidance that will help them grow professionally as a developer
Helping lead our PDX (Portable Developer Experience) meetings where we discuss, have workshops and generally look at how we go about development at Portable as a team
Collaborating with project managers to advise on scope for features as well as assist with the execution of the overall project architecture
Spending some time writing code - implementing new APIs for a justice project and adding new elements to the UI components for a public sector project

‘Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information.

534,"Director of Engineering, Machine Learning",Culture Amp,Melbourne VIC,"Who We Are
What do Airbnb, Slack and Salesforce have in common? They use Culture Amp every day to make their workplaces better, along with over 2,600 other companies from around the globe, making up a community who stand together to improve the world of work.
With offices in Melbourne, San Francisco, New York, and London, Culture Amp isn’t just for fast-growing startups - we’re for every organization that wants to put culture first. By making it easy to collect, understand, and act on employee feedback, we enable People teams to make better decisions, demonstrate impact, and turn company culture into a competitive edge.
It’s what makes us the world’s leading people & culture platform.
The Opportunity at Culture Amp
Culture Amp is seeking a Director of Machine Learning to lead our machine learning engineering team. This is an exciting opportunity to work with some of the best minds on complex problems in the area of natural language processing (NLP), recommendations, and foresight prediction.
As the first and largest people & culture platform we have more and better structured data than anyone in the employee feedback space. We already collect data from millions of employees across thousands of customers and many more in our People Geek community. We have leveraged that data to draw important insights for our customers to help them create better places to work. For Culture Amp machine learning plays a crucial and increasing role in helping our customers realise meaningful insights from our data moat. We continue to be committed to leveraging cutting edge techniques to uncover and communicate ever deeper insights and help our customers drive meaningful change.
Leading both people and the machine learning technology vision, this role will help us deliver numerous features that will have a significant impact for our customers.
Examples of where machine learning can help us unlock more value:
What are employees talking about? Negatively? Positively?
Which cohort of employees are most at risk of leaving?
What biases exist when giving feedback?
What actions are most effective for companies like yours?
What are the early indicators that somebody needs support to continue to be high performing?
Responsibilities include:
Hiring and leading all our machine learning engineers
Shaping the machine learning road map
Working with product managers to deliver world-first features
Strategically positioning Culture Amp for future success in machine learning
Educating and training others in the business about where machine learning could have a big impact
Setting the machine learning technology direction and future architecture
Bringing your hands-on experience of Python coding and developing models as well as deploying them to production to ensure our ML engineers can have maximal impact
Being able, when required, to roll up your sleeves and get on the tools to help the teams deliver
What you bring to our camp
You will help shape the future of ML at Culture Amp through guiding the development of the next round of machine learning features. You will guide features from conception through to implementation, by helping to identify the right features to build, and making sure we have the people and expertise to prototype and build them.
The conception phase starts with conversations with product managers and other stakeholders. Product managers are well placed to know what some of the customer problems are, but you will need to provide guidance on which of those problems ML can help with, and maybe find new opportunities which have not yet been considered.
You will need to have enough experience with machine learning to evaluate both the benefits and risks of any particular machine learning project. Does the customer value, justify the delivery effort and its associated uncertainty? And will the risks of developing an ML solution be acceptable? What level of accuracy is acceptable for this feature? You will need to be able to communicate this kind of information effectively with colleagues, product managers, people scientists, tech leads and delivery leads, who may not be aware of the technical details of machine learning.
During development you will need to know how to plan and scope, at a high level, the steps needed to implement an ML solution to a customer problem. From:
mapping the problem to something solvable with machine learning
prototyping possible solutions
creating necessary production services and integrating with the product to bring it to customers
delegating the details of this work to other ML engineers as appropriate
To achieve this, you will need to have broad knowledge of and experience with a wide range of ML algorithms and techniques (including traditional supervised learning, deep learning and unsupervised methods) and the tradeoffs of each as well as evaluation methodologies. You will also need a sound knowledge of the best practices for the production of ML projects, including how and when to annotate data to ensure system accuracy and provide training material, and knowledge of how to best leverage third-party data sources even when they do not match the domain perfectly (eg through techniques such as transfer learning). As we deal extensively with textual data, you will ideally have knowledge of natural language processing techniques.
You will also need to make sure the ML Engineers in the practice are set up for success to help achieve these goals. This includes making sure that we have the right people, that they are working in the appropriate parts of the company, and that they have the skills necessary for a particular project. You may need to upskill less experienced engineers on particular facets of machine learning as necessary.
What We Offer
You’ll be supported as you develop in your role and have access to great benefits such as our ‘Coaching for Everyone’ and ‘Learn Yourself Up’ programs. You’ll also receive a competitive package plus generous stock options, flexible working and other benefits."

Who is CHE Proximity
More than ever before the medium, the message and it's sequencing are inseparable from each other.
‘Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce.
This is what we call Connected Creativity.

Work type: Fixed Term
Location: Parkville

Department/School: Department of Management and Marketing
Salary: $102,967 - $122,268 (Level B)
Role & Superannuation rate: Academic - Full time - 9.5% super
We currently have an opportunity for an early-career postdoctoral academic to join our team of organization scientists, computer scientists, and mathematical biologists as part of a project funded by the Australian Research Council to implement parallel processing (on GPGPUs) and distributed computing methods (on cloud-based platforms) to study complex dynamic social and health systems. Formally employed on a two-year contract (with the possibility of extension conditional on funding) in the Department of Management and Marketing within the Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne, the successful candidate will share responsibility for coding existing and new algorithms that characterize and test causality using methods from dynamical systems research in ecology and applied physics. In conjunction with Associate Professor Michael Zyphur (University of Melbourne), Associate Professor Jinjing Li (University of Canberra), and Professor George Sugihara (University of California, San Diego), this two-year position will give the incumbent an opportunity to learn and apply new skills to help revolutionize data analysis in the social and health sciences. Throughout the year some travel to Canberra is expected, and the Postdoctoral Fellow may even choose to be primarily located in Canberra to more closely collaborate with Associate Professor Jinjing Li if this is of interest.
The successful candidate will have a PhD in Computer Science or equivalent, with data science and/or software engineering expertise using Python and C. Experience with package development in R may be helpful but is not necessary. The project will primarily focus on scientific computing applications to evaluate complex dynamic systems on GPUs and massively distributed CPUs (e.g., AWS platforms such as Lambda or equivalent). For the GPU case, programming in the novel and intuitive ArrayFire library will allow compiling for CUDA and OpenCL (as well as Python/C for local parallel processing on multi-core CPUs). For distributed computing on cloud infrastructure, in-house development using Python and C will be required. We do not expect prior expertise in all APIs / languages that will be used for the project, but we do expect the qualified candidate to have a strong interest in learning and using the required APIs / languages as needed as well as the background required to do so.

medical research
Work with one of Australia’s most respected national and independent
medical research institutes
Contribute to a project that is pushing the boundaries of knowledge
globally

Children’s Medical Research Institute (CMRI) was Australia’s first dedicated paediatric
research facility and is now one of the nation’s most highly regarded independent
medical research centres. Our research focuses on the areas of embryonic
development and birth defects, cancer, neuroscience and gene therapy and we have
a strong international reputation based on our research outcomes. CMRI’s research
programs are supported by state of the art facilities and committed research and
support staff. Our achievements are made possible by a loyal network of community
supporters, highly engaged donors and the very successful Jeans for Genes®
fundraising campaign.

A Biostatistician position is available in the ProCan Cancer Data Science Group, led
by Dr. Qing Zhong. ProCan (the ACRF International Centre for the Proteome of
Human Cancer) is a world-first initiative developed and launched in September 2016
by Professors Phil Robinson and Roger Reddel, and established with a $10 million
grant from the Australian Cancer Research Foundation (ACRF). Equipped with six
SCIEX mass spectrometers and a super computer (800TB / 480 cores), ProCan
processes tumour samples through a proteomic method, SWATH-MS, which allows
fast mass spectrometric conversion of small amounts of tissue (biopsy level) into a
single, permanent digital file representing the quantitative proteome of the sample.
ProCan’s aim is to measure thousands of proteins in 70,000+ samples of all types of
cancers with known treatment outcome and correlate cancer proteotypes with clinical
phenotypes. ProCan is the lead in a proteogenomics consortium that has signed the
first Memorandum of Understanding with the United States National Cancer Institute,
as part of the Cancer Moonshot Initiative.

The Cancer Data Science Group aims to develop novel computational tools and
sophisticated machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal. Other major focuses
of the group are 1) big proteogenomic data mining and management, 2) the genome-
proteome association analysis and multi-omic data integration for studying cancer, 3)
development of advanced statistical tools to account for batch effects caused by large-
scale, high throughput mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and 4) implementation
of big data-driven, evidence-based computational tools to achieve predictive,
preventive, personalized medicine.

We invite applications from PhD scientists to join our group. Applicants should have a
high degree of motivation in academic research, an excellent record of scientific
accomplishments with publications in peer-reviewed journals, and the ability to work
independently with outstanding communication and writing skills. Candidates should
have a strong background in biostatistics or statistics and be interested in cancer-
related genomics and proteomics. Knowledge in biostatistics, applied statistics, and
computational modelling is essential. Strong programming skills in R and Python are
required. Previous experience in proteomics would be helpful, but not essential. You
will be responsible for conducting biostatistical analysis, performing survival analysis,
developing solutions to problems such as batch effects, missing values and FDR in
the current proteomics research.

You will be provided with a competitive remuneration package in accordance with
qualifications and experience. Additional benefits include the provision of a Public
Benevolent Institution salary packaging scheme and participation in an employer-
contributed superannuation fund. This is a full-time position for two years with the
possibility of extension.

Applications should include:
1. A cover letter (citing PV2004) with statement of motivation and a detailed

Who is CHE Proximity
More than ever before the medium, the message and it's sequencing are inseparable from each other.
‘Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce.
This is what we call Connected Creativity.

HotDoc is looking for an ethically minded Senior Data Engineer to help us change how doctors and patients communicate. Help us take the next step forward on our journey in improving patient healthcare one algorithm at a time. Are you an operational thinker? Are you looking to apply your experience in building data analytic systems in a way that is meaningful? This is an incredible opportunity to work for a fast-growing health-tech startup where you have both scope and support for professional and personal growth, your opinions are heard, and your actions make a difference to thousands of patients and healthcare providers across Australia.

What’s in it for you?
We offer a market salary with startup perks. You’ll get to experience your contribution to the company first hand. Enjoy flexible work arrangements while thriving in an ethically driven company that fosters inclusivity and a collaborative work environment, where personal development and career progression aren’t just buzz words.

In this role, reporting to the Head of Operations, you'll help set a vision for data-driven, automated company operations, and work with a small team of dedicated engineers and data scientists to execute that vision.

Along the way, you will help set the way the operations data team functions — codifying HotDoc’s framework for incorporating new systems, datasets, reports, and analytics
Our stack is based around Stitch, Airflow, BigQuery, and Metabase, with a lot of Python glue — but nothing is set in stone.

Who will you be doing it for?
As the preferred vendor of healthcare software solutions, HotDoc is improving the patient experience for over 4 million Australians and counting.

Experience working directly with stakeholders to determine requirements at all scales, whether it’s to support a whole-of-business operations process, or a specific statistic to be included in a specific report requested by a customer
Experience leading engineers in a small, dynamic team (this role does not have formal direct reports, but is a senior role within the team)
Wisdom to know when to extend existing tools, when to build new ones, and when to just use a spreadsheet

Road safety
analysis
Associate Professor Shimul Haque, in
collaboration with partners, secured
funding from the Queensland Department
of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) to

advanced video analysis technology to
assess intersection safety performance,
with the aim of demonstrating the value
of the technology in pinpointing potential
crash risks. Video processing of data will
consist of the automated calculation of
a variety of surrogate safety measures,
conflict analysis, conflict severity analysis,
and violation detection.

UQ Centre of Hypersonics
UQ Centre of Hypersonics is globally recognised as the leading university-based hypersonics research group.
Our researchers, as well as our research programs have been recognised for their sustained, outstanding contributions and achievements in the advancement of atmospheric, hypersonic flight and related technologies for the past 20 years. We are internationally renowned for excellence and innovation, and have active collaborations with international universities and research groups, including those in France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan and India.
About This Opportunity
UQ’s Centre for Hypersonics has four PhD scholarship top-ups available for collaborative projects with the Defence Science and Technology Group (DST Group). The projects, detailed below, will be co-supervised by a DST scientist. The student will be based at UQ St Lucia, but will conduct their experiments at X3's new location with DST Group at Eaglefarm with DST technical support.
Projects 1 & 2: Radiation signatures
Supervisors: Professor Richard Morgan (principal) and Associate Professor Tim McIntyre (associate)
The radiation trails left behind in the shock layers and wakes of hypersonic flight vehicles are important foot prints which enable identification of the altitude, location, and direction of the vehicle, and may also be used to indicate something about their design and purpose. They may be created from radiating high temperature shock layers, and can be significantly enhanced by hot ablative products from TPS insulation and by combustion products from air breathing and rocket propelled systems.
Prediction techniques are not currently well advanced, and more experimental data and fundamental studies are needed to be able to confidently categorise and predict the signatures of specific vehicle configurations over their operational envelopes. The requirements for experimental studies include advanced hypersonic test facilities, the ability to create the associated sources of ablative and combustion products, and the instrumentation required to track the propagation and spectral intensity of radiating products in a hypersonic flowfield. The laboratories of UQ and DST are well suited to perform such a study, and have extensive expertise in the related diagnostics and instrumentation.
Project 1: The purpose of this proposed project is to perform a series of experimental investigations into these effects, focussing on ablation-driven radiating wakes.
Project 2: The purpose of this proposed project is to perform a series of experimental investigations into these effects, focussing on wake signatures produced by propulsion systems.
Interested in these projects? Read more about Professor Richard Morgan, and Associate Professor Tim McIntyre. To discuss these projects, please email Associate Professor McIntyre.
Project 3: High altitude Earth re-entry testing in a large scale expansion tube
Supervisor: Dr David Gildfind
A manned mission to Mars will see the fastest ever spacecraft return to Earth, up to 13 km/s. The engineering challenges of Earth re-entry at these speeds are still to be overcome, and suitable wind tunnel testing capabilities will be essential to fully understand the flow physics and to test new technologies at these speeds. One promising technology is magnetohydrodynamic aerobraking, which can potentially use the interaction between a magnetic field and the hot plasma enveloping the spacecraft to dissipate the spacecraft's immense kinetic energy when it first reaches the atmosphere, when speeds are a maximum but density is low enough to make heating manageable.
Australia is currently a world leader in aerodynamic ground testing of planetary entry flows, and its X2 and X3 facilities are routinely used to study Earth re-entry flows up to 11 km/s. However, neither facility can currently generate the low density part of superorbital flows associated with ambitious future missions such as deep space return from Mars or the Gas Giants. This project involves extending the test capability for X3 - the world's largest free-piston driven expansion tube - to make this testing possible.
The PhD will address several technical challenges which currently prevent this performance. X3's free-piston driver is currently limited by its piston mass; its current lightest piston, which has been structurally optimised for CNC machining from aluminium, weighs 100kg, but for these test flows the piston needs to be much lighter. This can only be achieved through structural optimisation using new manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing.
Control of piston dynamics becomes increasingly difficult as mass is reduced and acceleration increases. This PhD will develop an accelerometer diagnostics package to measure piston trajectory and thereby guide the development of new driver operating conditions. A recent prototype device has demonstrated proof-of-concept up to 2000g peak acceleration for this application; this PhD must extend this performance to 20,000g, and will examine how additional diagnostics can be integrated into the device.
Model size must be maximised, which is achieved with a nozzle expansion to the test section. However, X3's existing nozzles have not been developed for such high speeds and low densities, and a new nozzle will also be necessary to achieve the new testing capability. This capability will be verified through numerical analysis and finally experimental testing. The outcome of this project will be the world's highest performance superorbital aerodynamic test capability for deep space return re-entry.
Interested? Read more about Dr David Gildfind, or email him about this project.
Project 4: Development of high performance shock tube conditions
Supervisor: Professor Richard Morgan
The performance of high speed shock tunnels is limited by the constraints of speed, pressure, length scale, and the required test flow duration. Related to this is the scope and scale of experiments which can be performed in the facilities. Recent modifications to the X3 facility at UQ have led to new test conditions in the reflected shock tunnel mode which enable steady flow durations of the order of 10 ms to be reached with an 800 mm nozzle exit. This new operating mode, known as X3R, is currently limited to total pressures of the order of 10 MPa at Mach 7 with a 560 kg piston. This envelope can potentially be stretched to total pressures of 40 MPa and enthalpies up to the order of 6 km/s, at the expense of test time, by using lighter pistons. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the full potential operating envelope of the facility, and establish a range of calibrated operating conditions which will greatly extend our capability to do useful hypersonics research. Honours Graduates from Engineering, the Physical Sciences and Applied Mathematics all have potentially suitable backgrounds for this project. There will be a strong experimental component to the work, and students will need to have good analytical and numerical skills.

Times and technology have changed, but this remains our goal. Instead of wrangling single, SQL-based databases and ASP.net web applications, our MapR Hadoop platform runs across 200 nodes with multiple clusters and .net APIs and react.js/Angular 1&2 web products plugging in.
Our industry-leading partners’ real-world data sets and SAAS product requirements are growing along with their complexity so we need to bring more developers and engineers into our team. We’re hoping that’s you.
Predominately working with react.js, .net core and Scala/Spark, you’ll be building applications to solve real world problems (some of the largest and most complex in the Southern Hemisphere) to make a real difference to our clients.
FAQ:
What is it I’ll be working on?
It depends, you may be initially building out scalable APIs to handle massive requests, onto a functional user interface that delights our clients. You may then end up picking up Scala and Spark as you move around from product to product.
Fancy becoming as “Full Stack” [if you smile/grimace at the quotation marks, then you’re probably our kind of engineer] as you can? Depending on your progress and your chosen career path, there will be many opportunities for you to grow into our BigData space and become a Quantium full-stack engineer with genuine variety in your role
We’re pragmatists here with no fanboy allegiances. Want to use something new? If you can prove your case from an engineering and commercial perspective, then go for it! (Unless you're advocating for using Spark Streaming for a petabyte batch job. That was fun but ultimately nihilistic)
How do your teams work?
We work in multi-discipline teams so you’ll be working alongside Data Scientists, Analysts, Testers and Devops engineers, depending on the project
What are you looking for in the ideal candidate?
Firstly, you can be anybody, from any walk of life. Before we get to your skills we want you to know that we actively try to foster an environment where all our employees feel safe, welcomed and celebrated. We look for the same in all people we hire
You’ve built web applications for highly complex data focused problems with the end user in mind
You’re a pragmatist, a true engineer and love to solve complex issues
You’ve a github profile showing us your experimental qualities. We’ll see combinations ruby, node.js, rust, python, java, Scala, Haskell, C++, C# or even Malboge with a readme that says “seeing how this works”. We love people who like to experiment and are focused on solving the problem, using the best tool for the job.
Do you have a bullet point checklist for me to check off my suitability?
We know people are not bullet points but sure thing!
You have:
Experience developing web applications using a range of languages technologies
You understand how to build an API that can scale
A solid foundation in functional and/or object-oriented programming with data structures
A passion for solving problems and writing efficient applications
An awareness of considerations around structuring data on distributed systems to support analytic use cases
A passion for delivering high-quality, peer-reviewed, well-tested code

If you're looking for a role where you change the way things are done, then this is it.
When we bought media in-house we didn't put it in a corner, instead we centralized it in the strategic planning department, within experience. Why? Because we believe experience starts with the very first exposure to a brand and so bought and owned channels should be planned together across the entire experience.
Our approach is driven by data and technology. Data is a huge part of what we do as an agency and media, particularly programmatic, is no different. We're fortunate to have some excellent data scientists working with us helping to build the latest and greatest in models. From a technology point of view, we're bringing adtech and martech together and have a team of developers enabling this. You'll also be surrounded by brand and innovation planners, a UX team and Creative Directors who are all incredibly excited about this new offering.
Our client base has grown rapidly and is continuing on this upward trajectory. All of our clients are looking for fresh thinking in media. They cover a range of industries across education, energy, health and other service providers.

Responsibilities

Delivering addressable recommendations across Paid Social and/or Programmatic for clients which generate real business outcomes.
Mentoring and training the team to be able to help implement these solutions.
Leading relationships with media and data partners ensuring access of new innovations to CHEP clients.
Leading optimizations throughout the campaign.
Guiding the team to deliver solutions for today, as well as exploring new and innovative solutions for tomorrow.
Working with the planning team on recommendations and the reporting team on data insights. It's worth noting that all of our planning is agnostic and we work as one team so you won't be fighting to get programmatic ‘heard'.
Working with other departments in the agency to solve client's business problems.
Helping to educate the wider agency and other departments.
Desired Skills and Experience

A strong history of working in paid social and/or programmatic, across leading accounts.
The ability to deliver recommendations on additional partners and platforms.
Intelligent use of data in client recommendations.
Knows how to extract useful insights from data.
The ability to lead relationships with key media partners for the agency.
The ability to mentor and lead a team.
The ability to lead the training of other members of the media team and working to promote cross skilling.
Experience with DMP's will be preferred, particularly Adobe Audience Manager.

694,Senior UI Application Engineer,Xero,Sydney NSW,"Since 2002, our data teams have wrung every bit of information they can from our clients’ data in order to give them the insight they need to make a real difference to their business.
Our expertise in delivering highly complex data decisions based on our algorithmic and data capability. While this has been a core strength of ours since our inception, we have recently started investing in the look, feel and interaction our clients experience when using our products.
Part of this is building out a UI development capability. Working with Ben Buchanan (our Design Engineering Lead) we’re looking for someone with a passion for that intersection of design and engineering to come in and help, among other things, build our design framework and UI library, Qbit.
Role Details/FAQ:
What is it I’ll be working on?
The role will focus heavily on Quantium's UI library Qbit, which is framework-agnostic and currently supports React and Angular. Other work will include UI development in a range of cross-product work; and there are opportunities to work cross-stack into the application backend and endpoint design.
Who can I expect to work with?
We work in multi-discipline teams so you’ll be working alongside Data Scientists, Analysts, Testers and platform engineers, depending on the project.
This role sits on Quantium's cross-product Core Team, which is responsible for enabling quality engineering at scale; and will be working regularly with the Design team, responsible for the Quantium Design System (QDS).
What are we looking for in the ideal candidate?
Firstly, you can be anybody, from any walk of life. Before we get to your skills we want you to know that we actively try to foster an environment where all our employees feel safe, welcomed and celebrated. We look for the same in all people we hire
You will be currently working on a range of front end engineering and design components at scale. We’re not really fussed which JS framework you’re working with, so long as you don’t think it’s the only one worth using, core JS skills are more important. You will also consider CSS to be one of your primary skills, despairing when you hear “engineers” disparage the skill and talent it takes to build stacking content. HTML is an art as far as you’re concerned.
As time goes on, we don’t want to restrict you to just front end so you’ll also be keen to pick up some C#, while retaining your UI expertise.
This role is open to candidates who are already cross-stack; and also to strong UI developers who are keen to grow their backend skills.
Do you have a bullet point checklist for me to check off my suitability?
We know people are not bullet points but sure thing!
You have:
Lots of experience in interface development at scale, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and accessibility
Experience working with component-driven UI (ideally using in-house UI libraries)
Experience working with UI frameworks (eg. React, Angular)
Experience working with typed JavaScript variants (eg. Flow, Typescript)
An awareness of DevOps and an appetite to contribute to effective CI/CD pipelines
Experience working with a .NET/C# backend is ideal but not required
A love for knowledge sharing, you know what works, but you’re also happy to learn new methods and technology
Ok, the work sounds great, but what’s in it for me?
Quantium takes care of its biggest asset – our people. We believe there is more to a successful career than just hard work. To this end we provide a range of personal and professional benefits across six broad categories:
Career
Our exceptional growth means new and exciting career opportunities at Quantium. New clients, new projects or new roles – our growth plans power bigger and better career possibilities for our people.
Workplace
We work hard but we don’t take ourselves too seriously – ask anyone who has been on one of our annual trips away! Our people have cited ‘Fun place to work’ as one of the top 5 attributes of working at Quantium. Our world-class offices are fitted out with office games and stocked with food and drink all year round.
Financial
We offer a market leading range of financial and insurance benefits and entitlements.
Health and wellbeing
Healthy body, healthy mind. Quantium believes in promoting ways for you to maintain and improve your health and personal wellbeing. Our team enjoys a range of activities, including group fitness sessions, yoga, health advice and various team sports
Lifestyle

Who is CHE Proximity
More than ever before the medium, the message and it's sequencing are inseparable from each other.
‘Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce.
This is what we call Connected Creativity.

717,Postdoctoral Research Fellow,JBP scientists and engineers,St Lucia QLD,"Queensland Brain Institute (QBI)
QBI was established in 2003 and is home to more than 450 scientists and 42 laboratory leaders. Our researchers have made important advances in fundamental neuroscience and in diseases such as ageing dementia, schizophrenia and motor neurone disease.
Neural Migration Laboratory
The Neural Migration Laboratory is headed by Professor Helen Cooper. Professor Cooper’s research focuses on the molecular signaling systems (guidance receptors and their ligands) governing neural stem cell activity, neuronal differentiation and axon pathfinding in the embryonic brain. A major research theme, and the focus of this position, is understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning synapse formation and synaptic activity. The goal of the Cooper laboratory is to identify the molecular mechanisms contributing to cortical malformations and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. To address these questions the laboratory uses developmental mouse models, in vitro culture systems and state-of-the-art molecular and imaging approaches, including super-resolution microscopy.
About This Opportunity
Abnormal synapse formation leads to diminished synaptic transmission and impaired cognitive function. Delineating the molecular pathways that govern synaptic connectivity will not only provide key insights into the fundamental principles guiding the establishment of complex neural circuits, but will also shed light on the aberrant processes contributing to autism and schizophrenia.
This project will investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating synapse formation. The incumbent will be responsible for experimental design, data analyses, and manuscript preparation, and will also be expected to apply for both independent and collaborative funding to support their research focus.
This position is located at our picturesque St Lucia campus, renowned as one of Australia’s most attractive university campuses, and located just 7km from Brisbane’s city centre. Bounded by the Brisbane River on three sides, and with outstanding public transport connections, our 114-hectare site provides a perfect work environment – you can enjoy the best of both worlds: a vibrant campus with the tradition of an established university.
Our Ideal Candidate
You will hold a PhD in the area of neuroscience or cell/developmental biology, along with demonstrated and published experience in molecular or cell biology. You will be able to demonstrate experience in synapse biology or developmental neurobiology in addition to the use of mouse models and in the application of high-end microscopy. You will be able to interpret experimental data to plan subsequent experiments and troubleshoot techniques. In addition, you will be able to work independently, managing your time across conflicting demands whilst maintaining a high level of accuracy.
It is a condition of employment for this role that you will be required to provide evidence of immunisation against certain vaccine preventable diseases.
We value diversity and inclusion, and actively encourage applications from those who bring diversity to the University. Our Diversity and Inclusion webpage contains further information if you require additional support. Accessibility requirements and/or adjustments can be directed to recruitment@uq.edu.au.
What We Can Offer
This is a full-time, fixed term position for 12 months at Academic Research Level A.
The base salary will be in the range $69,342.89 - $92,782.26 plus super of up to 17%. The total package will be in the range $81,131.18 - $108,555.25.

About us
Seeing Machines is a world leader in driver-machine interaction. We harness human factors science to create artificial intelligence (AI) technology that observes the driver's attention – reliably, unobtrusively, and in real time – and intervenes seamlessly when necessary.
Specialised computer vision algorithms underpin Seeing Machines' core camera-based driver monitoring technology. Algorithms allow us to precisely track eye gaze, head position and pupil size while our state-of-the-art AI technology analyses the data to quickly and accurately detect driver drowsiness, distraction and microsleep levels. We work with some of the world's leading brands to deliver this technology, helping keep drivers and operators engaged across commercial transport and logistics, automotive, aviation, rail and mining industries.
The WHY of our technology
According to the World Health Organisation, over 1.3 million people die in road accidents, globally.
The American Automobile Association says that 1 in every 10 auto accidents in the US is fatigue related and that 25% of US car accidents are caused by distraction.
European Commission recommends that camera-based driver monitoring technology be mandated to enhance safety in cars, vans, trucks and buses from 2022.
Air traffic is set to double over 15 years and the world's aviation fleet is set to double in 20 years. This creates a huge demand for more pilots and air traffic management which increases pressure on training and safety frameworks for the aviation industry, globally.
Seeing Machines' Guardian technology for commercial fleets has been scientifically proven to reduce fatigue related driver events by more than 90%."

785,Lead DevOps Engineer,Avenir Consulting,Sydney NSW,"Since 2002, our data teams have wrung every bit of information they can from our clients’ data in order to give them the insight they need to make a real difference to their business.
Times and technology have changed, but this remains our goal. Instead of wrangling single, SQL-based databases and ASP.net web applications, our MapR Hadoop platform runs across 200 nodes with multiple clusters and .net APIs and react.js/Angular 1&2 web products plugging in. Our Hybrid on-prem/cloud platform is also coming along nicely.
Our industry-leading partners’ real-world data sets and SAAS product requirements are growing along with their complexity so we need to adapt our ways of working to allow for better CI/CD pipelines, performance, availability and all the rest of the “Devops” buzzwords. We need someone to lead the charge. We’re hoping that’s you.
Our Platform Team have done a wonderful job in providing as much support to our product focused engineering teams, but with some serious infrastructure initiatives underway, they need to focus on that area, while allowing for a team to allow us to deploy at scale.
This role is pivotal for Quantium to deploy and grow its machine learning product capability both in the local market and overseas by enabling effortless operation of the pipelines in hybrid environments.

Q.Refinery is the Quantium flagship offering for the banking vertical, ingesting millions of bank transactions, curating and enriching them using advanced analytical techniques. Our engineering team develops data pipelines leveraging Spark and the BidData ecosystem in order to deliver our analytics capability to our clients, either on premises or in the cloud.
Once you’ve shown what you can do here, you will be given the keys to the kingdom, bringing your knowledge and capability to the wider product engineering environment, building a team and a whole new capability.
Who can I expect to work with?
We work in multi-discipline teams so you’ll be working alongside Data Scientists, Analysts, Testers and platform engineers, depending on the project. For this role, however, you can be expecting to work far wider, influencing thought and direction.
What are we looking for in the ideal candidate?
Firstly, you can be anybody, from any walk of life. Before we get to your skills we want you to know that we actively try to foster an environment where all our employees feel safe, welcomed and celebrated. We look for the same in all people we hire
You’ve scaled the divide between systems and code many times previously, bringing harmony where previously there was confusion. Where fear and inefficiency previously resided, you brought joy and confidence in deploying at 4pm on a Friday.
You’re a pragmatist, a true engineer and love to solve complex issues agnostically, using whatever tool makes the most sense from a technical, people and business perspective

0,Software Developer,Fortix,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

23,Software Developer,Fortix,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

37,Software Developer,Fortix,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

53,Software Developer,Fortix,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

59,Software Developer,Fortix,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

Unsure where to start? Apply and explore all of the possibilities in: Applications Development, Database Development, Embedded Networking and OS Development, IT, Security, Test & Quality, Web Services, etc.
How You Can Stand Out Recent graduate or on your final year of studies toward a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or a related major such as Math, Physics You’re hungry to get your hands on new, exciting technologies and have a deep understanding of the fundamentals of computer science and engineering Up-to-date on programming and scripting languages You can tackle problems with ease and take a creative approach in debugging programs Excited to work on an extended team and can expertly collaborate with others Can be succinct and to the point using verbal and written skills
Who You’ll Work With
Our team of software gurus are busy programming magic across the globe on teams such as Engineering, Information Technology, Supply Chain, Customer Experience, Security and Trust, etc.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

81,Software Developer,Fortix,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

95,Software Developer,Fortix,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

115,Software Developer,Fortix,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

124,"Director of Engineering, Machine Learning",Culture Amp,Melbourne VIC,"Who We Are
What do Airbnb, Slack and Salesforce have in common? They use Culture Amp every day to make their workplaces better, along with over 2,600 other companies from around the globe, making up a community who stand together to improve the world of work.
With offices in Melbourne, San Francisco, New York, and London, Culture Amp isn’t just for fast-growing startups - we’re for every organization that wants to put culture first. By making it easy to collect, understand, and act on employee feedback, we enable People teams to make better decisions, demonstrate impact, and turn company culture into a competitive edge.
It’s what makes us the world’s leading people & culture platform.
The Opportunity at Culture Amp
Culture Amp is seeking a Director of Machine Learning to lead our machine learning engineering team. This is an exciting opportunity to work with some of the best minds on complex problems in the area of natural language processing (NLP), recommendations, and foresight prediction.
As the first and largest people & culture platform we have more and better structured data than anyone in the employee feedback space. We already collect data from millions of employees across thousands of customers and many more in our People Geek community. We have leveraged that data to draw important insights for our customers to help them create better places to work. For Culture Amp machine learning plays a crucial and increasing role in helping our customers realise meaningful insights from our data moat. We continue to be committed to leveraging cutting edge techniques to uncover and communicate ever deeper insights and help our customers drive meaningful change.
Leading both people and the machine learning technology vision, this role will help us deliver numerous features that will have a significant impact for our customers.
Examples of where machine learning can help us unlock more value:
What are employees talking about? Negatively? Positively?
Which cohort of employees are most at risk of leaving?
What biases exist when giving feedback?
What actions are most effective for companies like yours?
What are the early indicators that somebody needs support to continue to be high performing?
Responsibilities include:
Hiring and leading all our machine learning engineers
Shaping the machine learning road map
Working with product managers to deliver world-first features
Strategically positioning Culture Amp for future success in machine learning
Educating and training others in the business about where machine learning could have a big impact
Setting the machine learning technology direction and future architecture
Bringing your hands-on experience of Python coding and developing models as well as deploying them to production to ensure our ML engineers can have maximal impact
Being able, when required, to roll up your sleeves and get on the tools to help the teams deliver
What you bring to our camp
You will help shape the future of ML at Culture Amp through guiding the development of the next round of machine learning features. You will guide features from conception through to implementation, by helping to identify the right features to build, and making sure we have the people and expertise to prototype and build them.
The conception phase starts with conversations with product managers and other stakeholders. Product managers are well placed to know what some of the customer problems are, but you will need to provide guidance on which of those problems ML can help with, and maybe find new opportunities which have not yet been considered.
You will need to have enough experience with machine learning to evaluate both the benefits and risks of any particular machine learning project. Does the customer value, justify the delivery effort and its associated uncertainty? And will the risks of developing an ML solution be acceptable? What level of accuracy is acceptable for this feature? You will need to be able to communicate this kind of information effectively with colleagues, product managers, people scientists, tech leads and delivery leads, who may not be aware of the technical details of machine learning.
During development you will need to know how to plan and scope, at a high level, the steps needed to implement an ML solution to a customer problem. From:
mapping the problem to something solvable with machine learning
prototyping possible solutions
creating necessary production services and integrating with the product to bring it to customers
delegating the details of this work to other ML engineers as appropriate
To achieve this, you will need to have broad knowledge of and experience with a wide range of ML algorithms and techniques (including traditional supervised learning, deep learning and unsupervised methods) and the tradeoffs of each as well as evaluation methodologies. You will also need a sound knowledge of the best practices for the production of ML projects, including how and when to annotate data to ensure system accuracy and provide training material, and knowledge of how to best leverage third-party data sources even when they do not match the domain perfectly (eg through techniques such as transfer learning). As we deal extensively with textual data, you will ideally have knowledge of natural language processing techniques.
You will also need to make sure the ML Engineers in the practice are set up for success to help achieve these goals. This includes making sure that we have the right people, that they are working in the appropriate parts of the company, and that they have the skills necessary for a particular project. You may need to upskill less experienced engineers on particular facets of machine learning as necessary.
What We Offer
You’ll be supported as you develop in your role and have access to great benefits such as our ‘Coaching for Everyone’ and ‘Learn Yourself Up’ programs. You’ll also receive a competitive package plus generous stock options, flexible working and other benefits."

129,Software Developer,Fortix,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

134,Software Developer,Fortix,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

161,Software Developer,Rio Tinto,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

169,Software Developer,Feedzai,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

180,Software Developer,SafetyCulture,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

Welcome!

We're so happy you found us. Since you've come this far, it's safe to say you're curious about our story and what career opportunities exist, so we'd love to start by introducing ourselves.

Then & Now

Our story ( https://envato.com/blog/the-story-of-envato/ ) starts in 2006 with three founders in a Sydney garage (no, we're not kidding). Born from a desire to earn a living doing what they loved, with the flexibility ( https://envato.com/blog/flexibility-at-the-heart-of-life-at-envato/ ) to do it from anywhere, Envato set out to create an online community for buying and selling creative digital assets. Nearly 13 years later, we're profitable and still totally bootstrapped. This allows us to stay experimental and totally focused on the best interests of our authors & customers around the world.

We've built marketplaces where anyone can buy and sell the creative assets they need to complete their projects faster. Our community can now buy millions of different kinds of assets on Envato Market ( https://themeforest.net/ ), or subscribe to the #1 unlimited subscription service for creatives, Envato Elements ( https://elements.envato.com/ ). Every day, these products continue to help everyone from freelancers to small business owners and agencies get their creative projects done.

While we are known and loved within the digital professional community globally, where our authors have earned over $750 million ( http://press.envato.com/172514-envato-closes-in-on-1-billion-usd-in-community-earnings ), we also want to be a place where anyone can Make with Envato.

With over 600 people globally, we have offices in Guadalajara, Mexico ( https://envato.com/blog/placeit-joins-envato/ ) & Los Angeles ( https://envato.com/blog/twenty20-joins-the-envato-family/ ), alongside our funky Melbourne HQ.

209,Software Developer,Rio Tinto,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

215,Software Developer,Amazon Corporate Services Pty,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

244,Software Developer,Rio Tinto,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.

263,Software Developer,Fractal.ai,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

279,Software Developer,AWS Australia Pty Ltd,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

295,Software Developer,Amazon Corporate Services Pty,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

310,Software Developer,Reesby Recruitment,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

326,Software Developer,ARQ Group,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

329,Lead DevOps Engineer,Onset,Sydney NSW,"Since 2002, our data teams have wrung every bit of information they can from our clients’ data in order to give them the insight they need to make a real difference to their business.
Times and technology have changed, but this remains our goal. Instead of wrangling single, SQL-based databases and ASP.net web applications, our MapR Hadoop platform runs across 200 nodes with multiple clusters and .net APIs and react.js/Angular 1&2 web products plugging in. Our Hybrid on-prem/cloud platform is also coming along nicely.
Our industry-leading partners’ real-world data sets and SAAS product requirements are growing along with their complexity so we need to adapt our ways of working to allow for better CI/CD pipelines, performance, availability and all the rest of the “Devops” buzzwords. We need someone to lead the charge. We’re hoping that’s you.
Our Platform Team have done a wonderful job in providing as much support to our product focused engineering teams, but with some serious infrastructure initiatives underway, they need to focus on that area, while allowing for a team to allow us to deploy at scale.
This role is pivotal for Quantium to deploy and grow its machine learning product capability both in the local market and overseas by enabling effortless operation of the pipelines in hybrid environments.
It’s at this point I’d normally give you an overview of the tech involved. But let’s face it, you know that way better than us. That’s why we’re hiring this role.
Role Details/FAQ:
What is it the I’ll be working on?
We have an initial product environment for you to use as your test bed, to get to know the business and the ways we have been working up to now.

Q.Refinery is the Quantium flagship offering for the banking vertical, ingesting millions of bank transactions, curating and enriching them using advanced analytical techniques. Our engineering team develops data pipelines leveraging Spark and the BidData ecosystem in order to deliver our analytics capability to our clients, either on premises or in the cloud.
Once you’ve shown what you can do here, you will be given the keys to the kingdom, bringing your knowledge and capability to the wider product engineering environment, building a team and a whole new capability.
Who can I expect to work with?
We work in multi-discipline teams so you’ll be working alongside Data Scientists, Analysts, Testers and platform engineers, depending on the project. For this role, however, you can be expecting to work far wider, influencing thought and direction.
What are we looking for in the ideal candidate?
Firstly, you can be anybody, from any walk of life. Before we get to your skills we want you to know that we actively try to foster an environment where all our employees feel safe, welcomed and celebrated. We look for the same in all people we hire
You’ve scaled the divide between systems and code many times previously, bringing harmony where previously there was confusion. Where fear and inefficiency previously resided, you brought joy and confidence in deploying at 4pm on a Friday.
You’re a pragmatist, a true engineer and love to solve complex issues agnostically, using whatever tool makes the most sense from a technical, people and business perspective

What does Success look like?
After 1 month, you’re embedded within the team, you can easily engage with various team members, digest comments and raise constructive feedback. You understand the Refinery pipeline and its development lifecycle. You’re already hands-on in operating the already in production capabilities
After 3 months, you’ve been proposing significant improvement in our development pipelines and ease the process of building, testing and deploying Q.Refinery
You understand well the Quantium environment and knows how to navigate the organization
After 6 months, you’re operating Q.Refinery at scale and can infuse some of your knowledge in other teams and communities at Quantium. You liaise actively with the various platform teams to create alignment and drive betterment of our engineering capability
After 1 year, you’ve unified the way we manage our pipelines at Quantium beyond Q.Refinery
You’ve established automatic and resilient technical and human processes our minimize the operation overhead and risks

331,Data Engineer 2020,Onset,Sydney NSW,"Many organisations talk about data analytics and really have no idea about it. Even more these days talk about Data Engineering, Machine Learning and Distributed Systems and don't really do any of it.
Please rest assured the above is not the case as we are talking about a ""specialist"" here.
A data consulting business working with robust corporate customers across Australia, NZ, SEA and the UK.
Here there is a culture of ongoing education, team, customer centricity and early adoption of data analytics technologies (specifically cloud-centric).
The head office has harbour views and operates very much as the central HQ for all consultants, so you'll spend a few times a week here. Most of your time, however, will be spent on client sites; ranging from banks and retailers to global technology companies (some pretty cool ones).
We're not going to list every Data Engineering tech under the sun here, but if you have experience with:
AWS, GCP environments,
Spark,
SQL and languages such as Python, Go and Scala
You may very well be a fit for some solid projects here.
We are also open to candidates who have some data engineering experience and are looking to step into their first ""pure"" data engineer role.

341,Software Developer,Australian Government Department of Defence,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

360,Software Developer,Rio Tinto,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

376,Software Developer,Rio Tinto,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.

392,Software Developer,Rio Tinto,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

409,Software Developer,Rio Tinto,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take ambitious steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

438,Software Developer,Rio Tinto,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?

473,Software Developer,Earth AI Operations Australia,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.

516,Software Developer,ARQ Group,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

525,Software Developer,Rio Tinto,Perth WA 6000,"Hi, my name is Paul Faix and back in 2004 I started a multi award winning company Fortix. We have developed an end to end business management platform that is personalised for our valued clients. Most of our amazing clients are market leaders in their industries and relying on Fortix to help them grow.
For over 15 years I've been working with developers to create our product which we named Fortix Freedom. Being an engineer myself I can understand that it takes time to write a great code. I also learnt that our people love flexibility as of how, when and where they work.
Hence the reason I've never canceled anyone's leave requests or holiday plans. In fact quite opposite - I love when our people take rest and enjoy life without the screen. Our developers love hiking, rock-climbing, diving or just relaxing on the beach.
And here is the reason why it works for us:
We work on a single product and relentlessly pursue perfection. All value we create in our product we release to all our clients. So your engineering excellence directly adds value to our clients and our platform at the same time. A very different approach as the one of the time propositions where everyone is trying to save project time pushing you to do miracles overnight. Sounds familiar?
We allow a significant amount of time for engineers to pick work they would love to do on the platform. Only they can see what needs to be improved and changed so we give them plenty of opportunities to do that. Also we have roadmap driven development - you will be invited to contribute to the roadmap as well.
I know that it is not easy to leave the current work. So here is the deal.
I will make it easier. Forget all the HR departments selections - just send me a confidential email that you are considering working with us. I will send you job details and we can meet after hours to check your tech skills. Don't worry you don't have to be a rocket scientist to apply. If you have solid experience and passion for PHP programming and MySQL this could be the job for you.
We have it all ready for you to join us - work environment, place at our funky CBD office, senior engineer to guide you and help you get up and running quickly. Our collaborative culture is to support one another and your success will be our success.
You will be working as a project engineer supported by our long term team of core platform engineers. There will be plenty of help if you need it. You will be working on integration of 3rd party products using API's, rewriting legacy code, developing cool new features and many other exciting jobs.
One of the best feedbacks I've received from one of our long term employees was that each year it feels like he is working for another business - there is always something new to learn and explore.
Our business vision is set for the next decade. Becoming the best personalised platform for Small Business (SME’s) gives you plenty of amazing opportunities for growth and learning of new cutting edge technologies such as AI and machine learning.
If you ask me why I love my work I would tell you that it is because of my team and the amazing work they do. Our clients love us too. We enjoy a 5 star rating on Google and our business is growing. But my greatest achievement is never missing paying salary on time during the last 15 years. Perhaps one of many reasons best people are working with me for 10+ years.
Thank you for taking time to read the Fortix story. Now over to you. Help us to write the next chapter.
Let's have a chat.
PS: Need a sponsor? I've sponsored a number of people in the past. If you need help with sponsorship we can talk about it too.

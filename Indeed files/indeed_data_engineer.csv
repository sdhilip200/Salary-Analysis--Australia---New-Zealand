Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) build creative technical solutions to our customers' hardest problems. Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like “Why has our assembly line slowed down?” or “How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?” FDSEs lead the process of finding answers.

As an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. Like at a startup, you'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll have a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend.

You'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you're ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products.

With Palantir products as your baseline, you will leverage any technology you need to drive impact. It doesn't matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can pick new languages up quickly. We often face entirely novel problems, so solving them may require expanding your skillset. For example, we currently use:

A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end
Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

And if what you need doesn't exist yet? Go build it.

A career as an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could. As you rotate among teams, you'll dive deep into domains such as intelligence, energy, health, finance, and law enforcement. You'll learn from experts in these fields about their problems and the tradeoffs they must consider in order to solve them. Questions that seem simple from the outside will quickly become complex as you consider the nuances and consequences of every possible answer.
What We Value
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics.
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them.
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision.
Willingness and interest to travel as needed.
Requirements
Security clearance or the ability to obtain a clearance.

73,Deployment Strategist,AECOM,"Wellington City, Wellington","A World-Changing Company

At Palantir, we’re driven to solve the world's most critical and challenging problems, and believe that building software to enable human decision making is the most effective vector. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more.

What We're About

At its core, this role is about uncovering dots and—without knowing the shape they form—figuring out how to connect them. Our customers come to us with a hunch that the only way to protect their troops, manufacture high-quality products, structure effective healthcare policies, or deliver aid to refugees safely is to make better use of their data. Deployment Strategists are responsible for turning that hunch into reality.

If you believe in the transformational power of data and technology and in your own ability to bring that power to bear against complex problems, we want to meet you.

What We Do

Finding truth behind legacy systems and technical barriers is a problem that requires a curious and analytical mindset, a sharp intuition for product, an ability to speak the language of data, and an understanding that humans should make decisions.

As a Deployment Strategist, you'll work as part of a diverse team of Engineers, Product Designers, and other Deployment Strategists to deploy software against the most challenging problems our world faces. Everyone comes to Palantir with a unique set of experiences and skills, and that's what makes our teams generative and creative. Your mission is to synthesize disconnected streams of thought into a cohesive understanding of what the problem is, what the data means, what the product needs, what users are motivated by, and where the impact could be. You're not an over-planner or a manager — you're a do-er. Whether your to-do list is on your phone or on a paper napkin, you never let things sit there for long. You immerse yourself in our customers' most intricate workflows because that's where the answers lie. You explore the data using quantitative analytics across large datasets because that's where the truth is, and you dive into the product landscape because that's how we scale.
Deployment Strategists thrive in ambiguity. Rather than trying to walk in with answers, your default mode of operation is to begin with questions in pursuit of truth, value, and meaningful impact. You react quickly to new stimuli, and you don't equate pivoting with failing.
No two days are the same, but as a Deployment Strategist you can expect to:
Go onsite and meet with customer analysts to understand the critical questions they need to answer and locate their biggest pain points.
Build a case for gaining access to the relevant datasets, and work with Forward Deployed Engineers to integrate the data into a stable and extensible pipeline.
Create and lead training sessions to ensure that the product is meeting the needs of a range of users, and is being used widely enough to have concrete impact on our partners' operations.
Present the results of our work and proposals for future work to audiences ranging from analysts to C-suite executives.
Embed with our Software Engineering and Product Design teams to incorporate what you saw in the field into cross-Palantir product offerings.
Build and deliver demos to new and existing customers.
Scope out potential engagements in new industries and in increasingly expanding locations around the world.
What We Value
We value team members who aren’t satisfied with “what” because they know “why” is the juicier question. We value the desire to roll up your sleeves and dive into the details of the data because that’s the core of our work. And we value low ego because the outcome matters more than who gets the credit.
BA/BS (or MA/MS) or equivalent experience.
Extraordinary ability to take on open-ended problems in unstructured environments.
Adaptive and introspective; willing to learn, teach, lead and follow.
Experience with programming, scripting or statistical packages a plus (Python, R, Matlab, SQL).
Ability to travel 25 – 75% required. Varies by location and team.
Must be willing and able to obtain a government security clearance in New Zealand or have a pre-existing clearance that can be recognized.
If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, you may contact us at accommodations@palantir.com."

143,Software Engineer (Platform),Foodstuffs North Island,"Parnell, Auckland","Mobile-first disruptive tech | young ready-to-scale company | 'done-it-before' exec team
Are you ready to change how people communicate in a mobile-first world?
Here is what Spoke Phone is all about
Spoke Phone is a super-hot and fully-funded mobile-voice startup in Auckland.
We're a SaaS company with over 600 customers in just one year!
We believe the world will become mobile-first.
That's a world where employees prefer using a mobile phone, and where companies have more mobile and remote workers.
By 2025, over 50% of the workforce is expected to be mobile or remote, and they need better and more mobile experiences and capabilities.
Spoke Phone is going to own that future.
Here is what Spoke does
Spoke Phone has reinvented business communication, putting an entire enterprise-grade phone system inside a mobile phone.
We focus on the mobile user first (mobile-first design), making rich and simple user experiences on mobile phones.
Today, desk-bound workers have an advantage over mobile workers. The desk worker sits in the office and has this big screen with easy access to key business systems and customer information.
Spoke Phone brings these rich user experiences and connectivity available to desk-bound users and makes them easy-to-use on a mobile phone.
Why is Spoke Phone unique?
Spoke is all about mobile.
We are the only phone system designed specifically for mobile phones, and customers are loving it. Even Telcos love to hate Spoke Phone, with several Telecom companies now selling Spoke Phone and ripping out their own platforms.
Come join the Spoke Phone team and show us what you can do.
Here is why this job exists:
Our product and customer base is growing, and as they grow so does our roadmap. You will be part of our core team, working to maintain and extend the Spoke platform, writing and extending APIs and back-end services that our front-ends applications consume.
Our platform is fully serverless running on AWS Lambda, with our APIs exposed via GraphQL and data stored in PostgreSQL and DynamoDB. We use terraform to manage our AWS stack and use github to manage our codebase, continuously deploying via CircleCI.
We run a flat organisation and don't follow rigid scrum, kanban or any specific “agile” process; instead we prefer conversation and communication to deliver work continuously in an agile iterative way. We learn from our mistakes and are always improving the way we work and deliver working software.
Here is what you will do:
Write quality platform code - usually in Typescript or ES6/Node.js. On any given day you might be working on our core membership services, working on enhancements to our call handling gateway, or enhancing our routing and call logic to provide our customers with greater flexibility.
You might also occasionally help out with front-end work (and if you want to learn more, we're more than happy for you to do so!). Our mobile app is written in React Native, but our call stack is native code so sometimes there's a bit of Java and Objective-C or Swift code to be wrangled.
Work closely with the team to design and implement new features; whether it's database schema, API contracts, Integrations with Twilio or Stripe, or codebase architecture.
Deploy your code to production - sometimes daily via our automated build pipelines - that you'll also help to maintain.
Keep an eye on our production logs - as we all do - and flag any errors - fixing them along the way if you can.
Actively participate in reviewing everyone's pull requests. At Spoke the team owns the code and the team is collectively responsible for maintaining high standards.
Have fun, be successful, and most importantly, learn!
Here's who you are:
You are a software engineer with experience building platform APIs and services in Tyepscript or ES6/Node.js
Ideally you've worked in a SaaS product environment previously. It would be great if you have had exposure and some experience with AWS.
You're always looking to go deep on new technologies; at Spoke we look to gain advantage by adopting new, often bleeding edge platforms and frameworks.
You hold yourself to high standards; you're confident in your abilities but can check your ego at the door and know how to learn from mistakes (we all make them!)
Here's where you will work:
This is an Auckland based role, working in our co-working space in Parnell
You must already have the rights to live and work in New Zealand"

As part of a larger team providing the foundational technologies behind ASB, we're looking for the right people to build and facilitate the implementation and evolution of modern observability services and practices across and on behalf of our ENTIRE ASB technology team.
It's a large ongoing responsibility; a typical day might see us considering how a team can understand what the right choice is between using Docker and Kubernetes for their container management, how we can proactively understand the impact of moving to the latest version of Windows for a 20-year-old legacy application, or what's the latest unnecessary toil we can remove from a team just by better managing our data points?
As a Systems Specialist with an interest and desire to work on observability, you'll be keen to be part of a squad focussed on providing solutions to these types of challenges. You'll not only possess the technical skills to drive the implementation and scaling of modern monitoring, logging and alerting systems, but you'll have the voice to collaborate with other engineering teams and share your ideas on what the future could and should hold for observability at ASB.
This will include the following responsibilities:
Identifying and configuring data collection points from source systems or existing tooling
Building observability into our foundational technologies
Working with teams to meet their observability needs using appropriate alerting and dashboards
Operating the underlying hardware ensuring it meeting the capacity and performance needs of customers
About you:
We'll value your proven initiative, problem solving abilities and leadership skills as we look for every engineer to lead from their position.
With regards to background, you might have the following capabilities:
Experience with the Elastic stack of technologies in an observability context is a must.
Experience with AppDynamics will also be a huge advantage.
Experience operating the underlying hardware to run large scale observability solutions
Solid understanding and experience with a variety of technology logging and tracing mechanisms.
In addition, any of the following would be a huge bonus:
Experience specifically with Elasticsearch
Programming or scripting skills, especially in Groovy, JS or Python
Experience in defining Service Level Indicators and Objectives
Experience with other observability and monitoring tools like Datadog, Grafana/Promethius or Nagios

We offer a competitive salary and bonus, great banking benefits, heaps of personal and career development opportunities, flexible working styles, extra holidays and parental benefits.

108,Intelligence Specialist,HelloFresh,"Auckland City, Auckland","About the role
As an Intelligence Specialist, you will be assisting in the preparation and planning for military air operations. This includes researching, preparing and producing mission data. This may be presented as written reports, oral briefs or programmed software.
The Intelligence Specialist trade is comprised of two separate specialisations, Geospatial Intelligence Analysts and Electronic Warfare Specialists.
As a Geospatial Intelligence Analyst, you will receive training in the exploitation of satellite, electro-optical, infrared and radar imagery, as well as full motion video. You will also be trained in the use of Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) software, enabling you to display and analyse spatial data for the creation of maps and various graphics that supplement intelligence reports.
The Electronic Warfare Specialist is responsible for the analysis, production and programming of data across the electromagnetic spectrum in order to support electronic warfare equipment across the Air Force fleet. A technically challenging role, you will display a keen interest in utilising state-of-the-art equipment and software to analyse complex signals to produce high quality intelligence products. In addition to this, you will be involved in programming aircraft self protection systems that are designed to keep our aircraft and aircrew safe.
The NZDF’s commitment to international peace and security necessitates the deployment of aircraft and military personnel overseas. This can be in support of internationally led peacekeeping missions, or to partake in humanitarian aid and disaster relief requirements. As an Intelligence Specialist, you’ll play a vital role to support these operations either from New Zealand, or deployed within the operating environment.
Job on base
You will work with aircrew and Intelligence Officers in the preparation and planning for missions. This includes researching, preparing, producing and collating mission data, presenting oral and written reports as well as preparing visual aids for briefing purposes.
You will maintain computerised intelligence databases which involves inputting, storing and retrieving information. You will also interpret and analyse all forms of intelligence data to produce electronic warfare, geospatial and imagery-related reports and products in support of a broad range of Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) maritime, land and air operations.
In order to support this and following Recruit training, you will initially attend a Basic Air Intelligence course. Depending on your specialisation, you will be selected to attend intensive training in either electronic warfare, geospatial or imagery analysis followed by a period of consolidation at 230 Squadron to hone your newly developed skills. Throughout your career, you can expect to further extend your skillsets in specialist areas.
Job on deployment
All Intelligence Specialists will have the opportunity to deploy with squadrons on exercises or operations. You will spend time in other countries and experience a diversity of cultures and conditions as you support the activities of the squadron you are deployed with. Your duties on deployment will draw on your specific specialisation (Geospatial or Electronic Warfare) and have you working alongside aircrew and other intelligence staff.
At times you may be called upon to deploy on operations at short notice and to work shifts. Such is the varied and dynamic nature of the role that no day is ever the same as an Intelligence Specialist. You may be supporting an Economic Zone Patrol around New Zealand one day, and deployed overseas the next working a multinational exercise involving aircraft, ships and land forces.
My job is very diverse. I never have a day that’s the same.
I really enjoy doing the humanitarian aid and disaster relief planning because you feel like you're helping and making a difference in the world.

Specialist Training
You will initially be employed at 230 (Mission Support) Squadron in Auckland; home of the RNZAF Intelligence Trade and responsible for mission support to RNZAF Air Operations. At 230 Squadron you will be part of the Mission Support Flight (MSF) team working with either the Geospatial or Electronic Warfare Sections. You can expect to spend at least six to eight years at 230 Squadron during which time you will support operations and deployments both overseas and within New Zealand.
Over your career you may also complete six to twelve month exchanges with other NZDF and allied units. Options for overseas posts are also feasible along with ongoing opportunities for deployment. Intelligence Specialists continue to grow their skills throughout their career and will increasingly become involved in the management and coordination of staff; rising to become a Section Commander and ultimately potentially head up the Intelligence Team at 230 Squadron.
Upon successful enlistment into the Air Force you’ll be posted to RNZAF Base Woodbourne (near Blenheim). Here you’ll do 12 weeks of basic military training to
Organisation and Administration
RNZAF Customs and Protocol
Drill and Parades
Military Field Skills and Weapon Training
First Aid, and Search and Rescue Techniques
Physical Fitness
Following basic military training, you will be posted to 230 Squadron in RNZAF Base Auckland where you will undertake an initial induction process. This induction will introduce you to the different sections within the intelligence trade along with other supported flying squadrons. Following familiarisation to the unit and obtainment of appropriate clearances, you will undertake Air Intelligence Analyst Initial Employment Training at RAAF Base Edinburgh in Australia, to complete an analyst induction course. Post-graduation, you will return to 230 Squadron to undertake consolidation training.
Following advancement to Senior Intelligence Specialist classification, you will continue to advance and develop your expertise in the specialised and niche roles within your respective specialisation. This may involve further training courses both in New Zealand and overseas. You will also begin to undertake a mentoring role in order to develop basic leadership skills in preparation for progression up the chain of command. You can also expect to be deployed on various exercises and operations working in small teams to deliver intelligence support to air units.
As you progress to senior roles within the trade, you will focus on the leadership and management required to lead teams of analysts in support of military air operations. This will involve deploying as a lead of a small team and liaising with Intelligence Officers in support of flying squadrons to produce intelligence products.

125,Intelligence Specialist,Waikato District Health Board,"Auckland City, Auckland","About the role
As an Intelligence Specialist, you will be assisting in the preparation and planning for military air operations. This includes researching, preparing and producing mission data. This may be presented as written reports, oral briefs or programmed software.
The Intelligence Specialist trade is comprised of two separate specialisations, Geospatial Intelligence Analysts and Electronic Warfare Specialists.
As a Geospatial Intelligence Analyst, you will receive training in the exploitation of satellite, electro-optical, infrared and radar imagery, as well as full motion video. You will also be trained in the use of Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) software, enabling you to display and analyse spatial data for the creation of maps and various graphics that supplement intelligence reports.
The Electronic Warfare Specialist is responsible for the analysis, production and programming of data across the electromagnetic spectrum in order to support electronic warfare equipment across the Air Force fleet. A technically challenging role, you will display a keen interest in utilising state-of-the-art equipment and software to analyse complex signals to produce high quality intelligence products. In addition to this, you will be involved in programming aircraft self protection systems that are designed to keep our aircraft and aircrew safe.
The NZDF’s commitment to international peace and security necessitates the deployment of aircraft and military personnel overseas. This can be in support of internationally led peacekeeping missions, or to partake in humanitarian aid and disaster relief requirements. As an Intelligence Specialist, you’ll play a vital role to support these operations either from New Zealand, or deployed within the operating environment.
Job on base
You will work with aircrew and Intelligence Officers in the preparation and planning for missions. This includes researching, preparing, producing and collating mission data, presenting oral and written reports as well as preparing visual aids for briefing purposes.
You will maintain computerised intelligence databases which involves inputting, storing and retrieving information. You will also interpret and analyse all forms of intelligence data to produce electronic warfare, geospatial and imagery-related reports and products in support of a broad range of Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) maritime, land and air operations.
In order to support this and following Recruit training, you will initially attend a Basic Air Intelligence course. Depending on your specialisation, you will be selected to attend intensive training in either electronic warfare, geospatial or imagery analysis followed by a period of consolidation at 230 Squadron to hone your newly developed skills. Throughout your career, you can expect to further extend your skillsets in specialist areas.
Job on deployment
All Intelligence Specialists will have the opportunity to deploy with squadrons on exercises or operations. You will spend time in other countries and experience a diversity of cultures and conditions as you support the activities of the squadron you are deployed with. Your duties on deployment will draw on your specific specialisation (Geospatial or Electronic Warfare) and have you working alongside aircrew and other intelligence staff.
At times you may be called upon to deploy on operations at short notice and to work shifts. Such is the varied and dynamic nature of the role that no day is ever the same as an Intelligence Specialist. You may be supporting an Economic Zone Patrol around New Zealand one day, and deployed overseas the next working a multinational exercise involving aircraft, ships and land forces.
My job is very diverse. I never have a day that’s the same.
I really enjoy doing the humanitarian aid and disaster relief planning because you feel like you're helping and making a difference in the world.

Specialist Training
You will initially be employed at 230 (Mission Support) Squadron in Auckland; home of the RNZAF Intelligence Trade and responsible for mission support to RNZAF Air Operations. At 230 Squadron you will be part of the Mission Support Flight (MSF) team working with either the Geospatial or Electronic Warfare Sections. You can expect to spend at least six to eight years at 230 Squadron during which time you will support operations and deployments both overseas and within New Zealand.
Over your career you may also complete six to twelve month exchanges with other NZDF and allied units. Options for overseas posts are also feasible along with ongoing opportunities for deployment. Intelligence Specialists continue to grow their skills throughout their career and will increasingly become involved in the management and coordination of staff; rising to become a Section Commander and ultimately potentially head up the Intelligence Team at 230 Squadron.
Upon successful enlistment into the Air Force you’ll be posted to RNZAF Base Woodbourne (near Blenheim). Here you’ll do 12 weeks of basic military training to
Organisation and Administration
RNZAF Customs and Protocol
Drill and Parades
Military Field Skills and Weapon Training
First Aid, and Search and Rescue Techniques
Physical Fitness
Following basic military training, you will be posted to 230 Squadron in RNZAF Base Auckland where you will undertake an initial induction process. This induction will introduce you to the different sections within the intelligence trade along with other supported flying squadrons. Following familiarisation to the unit and obtainment of appropriate clearances, you will undertake Air Intelligence Analyst Initial Employment Training at RAAF Base Edinburgh in Australia, to complete an analyst induction course. Post-graduation, you will return to 230 Squadron to undertake consolidation training.
Following advancement to Senior Intelligence Specialist classification, you will continue to advance and develop your expertise in the specialised and niche roles within your respective specialisation. This may involve further training courses both in New Zealand and overseas. You will also begin to undertake a mentoring role in order to develop basic leadership skills in preparation for progression up the chain of command. You can also expect to be deployed on various exercises and operations working in small teams to deliver intelligence support to air units.
As you progress to senior roles within the trade, you will focus on the leadership and management required to lead teams of analysts in support of military air operations. This will involve deploying as a lead of a small team and liaising with Intelligence Officers in support of flying squadrons to produce intelligence products.
Salary and benefits
Careers in the Air Force are well-rewarded, as well as being diverse and exciting. As you become more experienced and move up through the ranks, gaining additional skills and qualifications, you will see your salary rise accordingly.

145,Data Scientist - Full Stack,Comspek,"Auckland City, Auckland","We are looking for a Full Stack Data Scientist to join the Qrious team.
Why 'full stack'? Well, you'll be involved in every stage of data science projects - crafting the objectives of a project, handling data, developing models, deploying services, and designing visualisations.

How you will make an impact
You'll work closely with other Qrious people to build deep understanding of what our customers need, the data that can be used, and apply a wide range of data science techniques to achieve a great outcome for them. Some of these projects will be one-of-a-kind bespoke solutions, whereas others will be further developed to become repeatable patterns and products.
You will go beyond just meeting a specification and use your creativity and technical expertise to create something that accelerates our development of Data Science and AI in Qrious. With support from our engineers, you'll be hands-on in implementing platform components as well as delivering value to Qrious and our customers.

What you'll bring with you
You'll balance big-picture vision and an enthusiasm for building new things with a methodical approach to enable re-use. You'll be comfortable working with people from a range of backgrounds, including engineers, scientists, and analysts, and be able to complement their strengths. The challenge of solving tough problems, building something from scratch and communicating deep concepts and outcomes will excite and energise you.

Ideally you will also:
Demonstrate a solid knowledge of the current state of the art in Machine Learning;
Be able to think deeply and creatively about solving hard problems across the stack, for which there are few industry standards or design patterns;
Hold yourself and others to high standards when working on customer and internal systems;
Be able to write technical design and architecture documentation for a variety of audiences;
Write high quality code. Python is our tool of choice, but we care much more about general development skills than knowledge of a particular language;
Take pride in delivering a project to its full completion and value generation, take ownership and responsibility for its success;
Experience working with AWS or other cloud providers is an advantage.
This is a fantastic opportunity to be a key player in an organisation making a real difference to New Zealand."

159,Deployment Strategist,Randstad,"Wellington City, Wellington","A World-Changing Company

At Palantir, we’re driven to solve the world's most critical and challenging problems, and believe that building software to enable human decision making is the most effective vector. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more.

What We're About

At its core, this role is about uncovering dots and—without knowing the shape they form—figuring out how to connect them. Our customers come to us with a hunch that the only way to protect their troops, manufacture high-quality products, structure effective healthcare policies, or deliver aid to refugees safely is to make better use of their data. Deployment Strategists are responsible for turning that hunch into reality.

If you believe in the transformational power of data and technology and in your own ability to bring that power to bear against complex problems, we want to meet you.

What We Do

Finding truth behind legacy systems and technical barriers is a problem that requires a curious and analytical mindset, a sharp intuition for product, an ability to speak the language of data, and an understanding that humans should make decisions.

As a Deployment Strategist, you'll work as part of a diverse team of Engineers, Product Designers, and other Deployment Strategists to deploy software against the most challenging problems our world faces. Everyone comes to Palantir with a unique set of experiences and skills, and that's what makes our teams generative and creative. Your mission is to synthesize disconnected streams of thought into a cohesive understanding of what the problem is, what the data means, what the product needs, what users are motivated by, and where the impact could be. You're not an over-planner or a manager — you're a do-er. Whether your to-do list is on your phone or on a paper napkin, you never let things sit there for long. You immerse yourself in our customers' most intricate workflows because that's where the answers lie. You explore the data using quantitative analytics across large datasets because that's where the truth is, and you dive into the product landscape because that's how we scale.
Deployment Strategists thrive in ambiguity. Rather than trying to walk in with answers, your default mode of operation is to begin with questions in pursuit of truth, value, and meaningful impact. You react quickly to new stimuli, and you don't equate pivoting with failing.
No two days are the same, but as a Deployment Strategist you can expect to:
Go onsite and meet with customer analysts to understand the critical questions they need to answer and locate their biggest pain points.
Build a case for gaining access to the relevant datasets, and work with Forward Deployed Engineers to integrate the data into a stable and extensible pipeline.
Create and lead training sessions to ensure that the product is meeting the needs of a range of users, and is being used widely enough to have concrete impact on our partners' operations.
Present the results of our work and proposals for future work to audiences ranging from analysts to C-suite executives.
Embed with our Software Engineering and Product Design teams to incorporate what you saw in the field into cross-Palantir product offerings.
Build and deliver demos to new and existing customers.
Scope out potential engagements in new industries and in increasingly expanding locations around the world.
What We Value
We value team members who aren’t satisfied with “what” because they know “why” is the juicier question. We value the desire to roll up your sleeves and dive into the details of the data because that’s the core of our work. And we value low ego because the outcome matters more than who gets the credit.
BA/BS (or MA/MS) or equivalent experience.
Extraordinary ability to take on open-ended problems in unstructured environments.
Adaptive and introspective; willing to learn, teach, lead and follow.
Experience with programming, scripting or statistical packages a plus (Python, R, Matlab, SQL).
Ability to travel 25 – 75% required. Varies by location and team.
Must be willing and able to obtain a government security clearance in New Zealand or have a pre-existing clearance that can be recognized.
If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, you may contact us at accommodations@palantir.com."

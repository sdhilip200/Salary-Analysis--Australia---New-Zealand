Our clients include Auckland Transport, New Zealand Rugby, BlinkPay, Starship Children's Hospital, SkyBus, Dimension GRC, Spark, ESR, Ministry of Education, New Zealand Post, and Auckland Museum.

Focusing on leanness and flexibility, the team you’ll join will be internally self-organising, allowing you to focus on managing work rather than people.

How We Build Software:

Taking our lead from the world of software product development, we structure solutions in a product-centric manner; continuously delivering improvements from a backlog of features. These features are taken from real stakeholder needs linked to clear objectives.

Our digital platforms are a mixture of custom components and external services that can be combined for a powerful and engaging experience. Our guiding principle is to only write code necessary to deliver experiences unique to users.

The Role:

We are looking for a Senior Business Analyst who will be the vital link between our information technology capacity and our business objectives.

Working in the capacity of Product Owner alongside both our commercial and technical team members, you'll nurture the goals, strategy and requirements of our clients' solutions from inception to delivery.

You'll define business requirements for the long-term roadmap of digital products and facilitating the elaboration of requirement details for pending development sprints. Owning and developing relationships with partner agencies will be integral to your role, working with them to optimise and enhance their provision of services.

You'll also help design, document and maintain business processes, and communicate key insights and findings to project teams and clients. Delivering value will be critically important to you, and you'll have a natural affinity for finding ways to improve value to our clients.

It is essential that you have worked in an agile development environment and are familiar with the development of user stories and/or other outcome-based methods for describing requirements.
Skills & Experience Required:
Comprehensive experience in business analysis and/or product ownership specifically for software development
Demonstrable experience writing user stories (examples in your application would be useful)
Demonstrable experience with the long-term development of product roadmaps
Demonstrable experience as a critical thinker, with the ability to devise alternative ways to achieving outcomes to the benefit of our clients
Strong written and verbal communication skills including technical writing skills
Experience in leading client-facing requirements workshops, both pre and post sales
Experience with working with 3rd party UI/UX designers and integrating them into agile software delivery
Ability to work with complex organisations with several stakeholders at once, and have proven strategies for facilitating prioritisation of tasks
Benefits:

Developer-lead organisation
Interesting, diverse, commercially-minded projects for big clients
World-class colleagues
Equal opportunity workplace, free from discrimination
A culture of collaboration and learning
Plenty of office perks and beautifully designed offices in the heart of Auckland

Who Is Propellerhead?

Our software powers some of the more interesting ideas in government, commercial and non-profit institutions in New Zealand. For each client, we are a technology partner. We believe continuous advances in technology allow us to utilise newer and better ways of solving problems for our clients and their users.

Our typical engagements are large-scale, but often start small. We concentrate on the right combination of methodology, architecture, technology, and operating model. We believe software’s ‘natural state’ is live, in front of real users, and used for the purpose it is intended. The earlier we can deliver working software the sooner we are creating value.

Culture And Approach:

Our teams are technology craftspeople, driven to discover the right combination of methodology, architecture, technology, and operating model.

Our company approach is designed to produce maximum value by stepping out of the way and clearing roadblocks for our people. We take influence from Holacracy, Agile, Lean Startup, and Design Thinking, and we deliver solutions in a series of small increments, each iteration providing insights and clarity on user needs.

We are problem-solvers who happen to use code.

Accredited Employer:
We have recently become an Accredited Employer with Immigration New Zealand. This means that if you’re not from New Zealand and want to move here and work for us, you can apply for the Talent Work Visa. These visas are easier to get, are often much faster, and are a direct path to residency.

Cover Letter:
It's critically important that you submit a cover letter with your application - we cannot progress your application without one. It needs to be at least 200 words, and is your chance to tell us more about who you are and what you value. This is very important to us.


You Must Be In Auckland For The Interview:
We cannot hire you without meeting you in-person first. Please don't apply unless you can travel to Auckland for an interview. Current European hiring may mean we are in Europe periodically."

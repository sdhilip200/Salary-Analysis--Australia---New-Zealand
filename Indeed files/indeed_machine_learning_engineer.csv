We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

About the role

You will be trained to operate and fight from an armoured Pinzgauer, light operational vehicle (LOV) and trained in the skills of mounted reconnaissance. This involves working under pressure in a confined space, by day or night, in all weather conditions over varying terrain, anywhere in the world.

Career progression and training
Basic Training
Job Training

Initial training consists of three modules which equate to approximately 7 weeks of training. Mod 1 and 2 are conducted throughout the year, and Mod 3 in January. It is preferable that you are able to complete these modules back to back.

MOD 1

The purpose of Mod 1 is to familiarise recruits with the Army prior to them attending the Recruit Territorial Force All Corps Basic Module Two.

This is a two day introduction to life in the Army. During this period you will be introduced to drill, Military Law, and the Ethos and Values on the NZ Army. You will also be taught how to live in a military environment and the standards that are required of you over the next two modules. Mod 1 and 2 are conducted annually in mid-November

MOD 2

The aim of this course is to produce a soldier capable of a fulfilling an appointment within an infantry section. The Mod 2 is a 28 day course conducted immediately after the Mod 1.

During the Mod 2 you will be introduced to:
Drill,
First Aid
Introduction to the IW MARS-L rifle, including maintenance. You will conduct live firing on the range in order to qualify on the Annual Weapon Shoot
Living in a field environment, including patrolling procedures, and operating in a rifle section
Introduction to Physical Training, including the Army Fitness Test
MOD 3

Mod 3 is conducted in early January and is a continuation module building on skills you have learnt, and providing you with further skills to enable you to be a section member within a rifle section.

This is a further 21 days of solid training, and at the completion of this module you will be ready for service and employment within your Reserve Unit.

During your final period of initial training you will:
Continue to develop your talent on the drill square.
Broaden your understanding of military law to include “The Laws of Armed Conflict”
Conduct, the Army Required Fitness Test (RFL), swim test and timed pack walk.
Get an introduction to the various infantry platoon weapons systems. This involves understanding the characteristics of the weapons, basic maintenance, and their employment. You will fire the LSW machine gun, the M72 anti armoured weapon system, 40mm grenade launcher and throw the high explosive (HE) hand grenade.
Finally you will further develop your field-craft and battle-craft skills culminating in a field exercise where all your newly-learned skills will be tested

Over the course of the three modules of training you will cover the majority of the activities that are conducted on the Regular Force All Arms Recruit Course. However, you will only be given an introduction and will continue to develop your skills within your home unit.

As an Armoured Combat Specialist your training progression is based on licences, and how long it will take you to achieve a class 2 full.

PINZGAUER (LOV) COURSE

Once you have a class 2 licence you will be eligible to conduct the LOV familiarisation course. This involves learning how to conduct basic maintenance and operating of the LOV. You will learn how to drive this vehicle over all types of terrain in both day and night. Once you are qualified on this course you can then be employed as a driver in the troop

Until you have completed the LOV course you will be employed as an operator out of the LOV. This could involve manning the Mag 58 machine gun from the top of the vehicle or employ one of the various infantry weapons systems used.

After a few years within the troop, once you have become proficient in the various roles of an Armoured Combat Specialist and have gained some leadership experience you may be selected to complete a LOV Crew Commanders Course. This will see you in command of the vehicle and the personnel within the vehicle.

Salary and benefits

As a Reservist you are paid on an hourly rate rather than a salary. Pay rates depend on the role you are in and your rank; your pay will increase as you move through the ranks.

As an Army Reserve soldier, the minimum remuneration you will be paid from day one is a daily rate of $148.82. Your remuneration will increase on promotion and seniority.

19,Trainee Estimator - Hamilton,PlaceMakers,"Hamilton, Waikato","PlaceMakers is a dynamic, interesting and fast paced environment to work in. We also happen to be one of New Zealand's leading and largest suppliers of building materials and a very successful business unit within the wider Fletcher Building Group.

Our National Estimating Unit provides residential and light commercial construction quoting and pricing services to our branches across the country. The National Estimating Unit has busy teams in both Hamilton and Christchurch and to support this growth we are looking to take on a Trainee Estimator in Hamilton.

This is a full time permanent position, Monday to Friday. You will start on $20 an hour as a trainee, however we have 3 monthly reviews with skills based pay increases, so if you are learning and performing well your pay will grow fairly quickly – it’s all up to you!

So what sort of person are we looking for?
You’ll need to have had some work experience as this is not an opportunity for someone completely green with no idea as to what they want to do.
You might be a builder already and you may have decided that you like the pricing side of things and feel a career in this discipline is up your alley.
You may be an admin superstar with a flair for numbers, figures and Excel and keen on the idea of working in the building industry
We aren’t going to explain what estimating is – you’ll need to do some research and learn more about quantity surveying and estimating to see if it’s for you.
You will need to be someone who is naturally pretty good with numbers.
This role will suit someone who is a bit of a perfectionist by nature and likes to get into the detail of things
You’ll need to be a natural problem solver as a big part of this role involves working with information that is not necessarily complete. So you’ll need to have confidence to ask questions, and look for answers rather than just be a processing machine.
You don’t need to be a guru at MS Excel, but you’ll need to know your way around a basic spreadsheet
This is an office-based job so computing must be something you're attracted to.

It’s not often that opportunities like this come up where a business will train you into a specialised and skill short sector which will almost guarantee you satisfying work for your entire career. So we will be looking for someone hungry and driven, someone with an exceptional work ethic who appreciates that we will be investing in you. Your ability to listen, communicate well and work collaboratively with the team will of course be important. An inquiring mind and ability to feel confident to ask questions and look for solutions will be another key item we will be looking for.

Applications close Friday 28th Feb, but we will view them as we receive them. The first interview for this role will be done using video interview technology.

To apply please visit www.fbcareers.com and quote reference PMK / 15572

Please note – you must be in NZ and entitled to work to apply for this vacancy. A medical which includes a drug screen will be part of the recruitment process for this opportunity.

Hours are 10.30am - 7.30pm Monday -Friday, so you'll get a sleep-in every day, or a good workout at the gym if you prefer, and feel like you actually get to have a life outside of work (add to that the fact that finishing at 7.30pm means you'll likely get out of having to cook dinner and it's a definite win/win!!).
Zag is an innovative IT consultancy and we specialise in 5 key areas (SAP, Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), Product Development, AI and Machine Learning and Spatial technologies. We're innovating all the time and expanding our footprint, This role sits mainly within our SAP practice and so we're looking for some who has experience in application support. It'd be wonderful if you have worked with SAP before, but we can teach you this as long as your application support skills are rock solid.
Our SAP Practice is filled with super talented Consultants who implement pretty grunty SAP solutions for our Customers (think HR and Finance applications, think eCommerce systems and Supply Chain software ...) after it’s implemented, we have a dedicated team of Support Consultants who maintain it, look after it and support it so our Customers can get on with their jobs.
But technology sometimes likes to throw a tantrum, and users of the system sometimes don't quite know how to figure it out - and that's where you come in....in this role you'll be absolutely pivotal to the success of our Support function. You'll be primary point for service desk operations and ultimately the one to ensure SLA's are met and incidents resolved in a timely manner. You'll receive, prioritise, and allocate customer tickets and be responsible for requesting additional resource from delivery teams when needed. You'll be required to escalate calls to the Service Delivery Manager or appropriate Business Line Manager when SLA's are at risk of not being met. You'll work with all of our Support Consultants and all our Support Customers both in NZ and AU and will ultimately coordinate the resolution of their system issues.
But you already know how this all works, because you're likely already working in an Application Support role. Maybe you've never had the chance to work with SAP? This could be your opportunity!! Or maybe you have worked with SAP before and you'd like to again...or maybe you're working with SAP now and want to further stretch yourself and work for the #1 SAP Consultancy in NZ.

Responsibility will fall to you to to ensure the integrity of the information created within the Zag ITSM system by carefully reviewing all tickets created, together with ensuring that customer collateral is valid and up to date. You will also have responsibility for the Support Desk 0800 number.

You will jointly administrate SAP Support Portal and SAP Partner Edge for Zag (don't worry if you don't know what these mean) with our Support Analyst (who is awesome!) and will be responsible for maintaining the ITSM internal systems operations. This includes (but is not limited to);
Assisting with implementation and deployment of the FreshService system

As a GSE Technician you’ll be a member of the ground crew, responsible for maintaining the ground-based equipment required to support military air operations, including keeping a tented camp on overseas operations running. Your duties will include the routine maintenance and repair of a large range of specialist military equipment.
Job on base

Ref: 35877 | Hamilton (Newstead) | Architecture & Security | Experienced | Permanent | Solutions Architect 040119.pdf
What is Solution Architecture all about? We'd love to hear what you think.
Do you want to work somewhere you can make a difference? Somewhere you can grow and take on new responsibilities?
Do you want to work in an organisation where your work matters to the people around you, and to New Zealand?
At LIC we're looking for Solution Architects ready to take the next step in their career. If you're passionate about how software gets built, and getting it built in the right way and for the right reasons, we'd love to hear from you.
What sort of person are you?
You believe that when people are given autonomy, they can build mastery on work that has purpose. You'll have a deep understanding of technology, how it works, how it is made and how it impacts human beings.
You understand that it's not enough to design a system and throw it over the fence. You'll be collaborative and comfortable with leading and facilitating conversations. Keeping your skills fresh by coding, teaching or mentoring is important to you. You work well in an environment where everyone is open to input and feedback from anyone, regardless of seniority; and where staff treat each other with respect.
You might be an app dev specialist able to talk about the trade-offs of serverless and microservice architectures or an integration specialist who can make the most of off-the-shelf enterprise software. Maybe you have a background in helping business units who want to digitally transform and love solving problems.
You might be, or have been, in a technical role, maybe as a senior developer or tech lead. Maybe you did operations or testing. You could have been in a technology adjacent role doing business analysis, product ownership or scrum mastery. In any case, if you're smart and like a challenge then we're really keen to talk to you about your understanding of software and how software should be produced.
Each day is different
You'll be part of our Architecture and Strategy team. A day in your life on the team might start with attending stand-ups. Next, you might collaborate on a solution design with other architects and then with our product friends as they decide what features we should be building for farmers. You may find yourself writing code or drawing diagrams with a team for an hour or two. They love working on all kinds of challenges with us. Once you refreshed yourself with lunch in our cafeteria and grabbed a coffee, you could round out the day with a few workshops with folks from across the business and if it's a Thursday or Friday your last stop might be at the social club for a game of pool and a chat with your colleague-friends before you head home.
That's what one day might look like, it might look wildly different on others. Longer-term, being at LIC means working in perhaps one of the most interesting and complex business domains in the country. You'll work across genetics projects, diagnostics initiatives, we have work involving herd testing, animal evaluation, herd compliance with legislation and building web and mobile applications for NZ farmers.
We have work involving satellites, robots, automated things, manual things, things involving cows and more! Have you ever wanted to design a system that can measure grass from space? Have you ever woken up at night thinking: ""There must be a way of using machine learning to understand how healthy a cow is?"" We have, you might be involved in taking that system to market.
A bit about LIC
We all have our improvement stories to tell. At LIC we believe in constant improvement, never settling and always striving for greatness. We know little improvements can add up to huge gains for our customers, and for our country. We value NZ primary industries and will do whatever it takes to support and grow our farmer community. We're down to earth and we're a diverse bunch - a mix of super smart scientists, veterinarians, farmers, sales people and clever marketing folk. We are inclusive and count ourselves lucky to have people from all backgrounds working with us.
LIC is based in Newstead, Hamilton, where we enjoy more affordable housing, relaxed commuting, easy parking and a readily accessible outdoor lifestyle. Our campus is in a rural setting just outside Hamilton and includes a social club, swimming pool, onsite parking, tennis and volleyball courts and a café with great coffee. We also offer generous sick leave entitlements, extra leave days per year, family leave for new parents, discounted insurance, employee shares scheme, mental health & well-being program, internal training programmes and an employee assistance programme to name but a few - and we're still working on improvements!
How to Apply
If you're after a rewarding and social career with people who embrace our company values of Integrity, Innovation, Spirit of Co-Operation, In-tune and Passion, then we would consider ourselves lucky to welcome you on-board.

Rocket Lab is the global leader in dedicated small satellite launch. Launching from right here in New Zealand, we design and build innovative technology to give small satellites a premium ride to orbit.

Small satellites play a crucial role in our day-to-day lives – they connect us, keep us safe, help us understand our planet and manage our impact on it, and they enable us to innovate and explore. There are endless possibilities for what we can achieve with better access to space, and that access is now a reality thanks to Rocket Lab.

Our relentlessly innovative team is behind Electron, the world’s only truly commercial small satellite launch vehicle in operation today. With multiple orbital launches under our belt and a record of 100% mission success, we’re opening access to space to improve life on Earth. We’ve built a world class team with a reputation for doing the impossible. Collaboration is at our core - every idea is heard, and everyone makes a difference. Every day, we pursue ideas that challenge, excite and demand more of us, and we make them real. Be a part of it.

About the role

As Rocket Lab evolves, so does growth and opportunity across our company. An exciting position has opened to join our Avionics team as a Harness Technician. This role will suit somebody who is passionate about working collaboratively in a team environment but also is comfortable working autonomously. We encourage you to bring your creative ideas to the table, suggest any improvements that can be made but also display aptitude to follow instructions. You will excel in this role if you have an appetite for learning and actively take on jobs that fall outside your schedule.

Key responsibilities:

Fabricate, assemble and test high quality, high reliability wire harness and electro-mechanical assemblies
Tasks require use of cabling tools such as soldering irons, crimping, torquing, potting and harness form boards
Testing tasks require the use of a multimeter and automated testing equipment

Collaboration is at our core - every idea is heard, and everyone makes a difference.

We get things done. Our team is nimble, decisions are made quickly, and we are action oriented. While other companies talk about it, we do it. This means projects get the green light faster and ideas are put into practice rapidly.

Everyone works on the big stuff. This isn’t a huge aerospace company where you get lost in bureaucracy and end up a tiny cog in a giant machine. At Rocket Lab, your work directly impacts the success of each mission. Everyone’s voice is heard, and everyone can contribute major projects. This is your chance to play a pivotal role in developing space systems that change the way we access space.

There's no limit to the ambition that we have to create smart, data-driven decision-making capabilities: our Data Analysis Framework is the building block on which numerous engineering teams rely to automate their data processing.
